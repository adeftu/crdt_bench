1. Set up sbt [https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki/Getting-Started-Setup]

1.1. Download sbt-launch.jar and place it in ~/bin.
1.2. Create a script to run the jar, by placing this in a file called sbt in your ~/bin directory:
java -Xmx512M -jar `dirname $0`/sbt-launch.jar "$@"
1.3. Make the script executable:
$ chmod u+x ~/bin/sbt

2. Run sbt in this directory:
$ sbt

3. Run all tests [src/test/scala]:
> test
(Before running Bench.scala edit bench.properties file first!)
